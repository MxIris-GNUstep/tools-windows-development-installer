When you think you encountered a bug in the installer, typically the
case when a dialog popped up referring you to this file, you can take
a look at the installer log and try to figure out yourself what
happened. All logging is done in
<GNUSTEP_INSTALL_DIR>\Development\MSYS\1.0\Installer\log.

If that doesn't help you, contact either tkoelman@xs4all.nl or
woudshoo@xs4all.nl.  Include in the mail the file 
<GNUSTEP_INSTALL_DIR>\installer.tar.bz2, which is created
when the build-failed-dialog shows itself.
