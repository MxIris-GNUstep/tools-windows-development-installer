Introduction
------------

This README describes how to build a GNUstep development installer.

Short instructions
------------------

The basic way of building an installer is by running:

perl make.pl -packagespath input

Where "input" is the directory containing the external packages.
Also help is available by

perl make.pl -man


External packages going into the installer
-----------------------------------------
The external packages are files that we want to have installed.
They should all appear in one directory and follow the following 
naming pattern:

PATTERN			  EXAMPLE FILE NAME		  DESCRIPTION

MinGW-(.*).exe		 - MinGW-3.1.0.1.exe		- The build tools
MSYS-(.*).exe		 - MSYS-1.0.9.exe		- The tools needed for .configure
ffcall-(.*).tar.gz	 - ffcall-1.8d.tar.gz		- The foreign function interface
gnustep-make-(.*).tar.gz - gnustep-make-1.9.1.tar.gz	- The Gnustep make package
gnustep-objc-(.*).tar.gz - gnustep-objc-1.3.0.tar.gz	- The ObjC runtime
gnustep-base-(.*).tar.gz - gnustep-base-1.9.1.tar.gz	- The base library
gnustep-gui-(.*).tar.gz  - gnustep-gui-0.9.4.tar.gz     - The gui library
gnustep-back-(.*).tar.gz - gnustep-back-0.9.4.tar.gz	- The backend
libiconv.*.bin.woe32.zip - libiconv-1.9.1.bin.woe32.zip - The character encoding library
jpeg.*.zip		 - jpeg-6b-3-bin.zip		- The jpeg library
libpng.*.zip		 - libpng-1.2.8-bin.zip		- The png library
tiff.*.zip		 - tiff-3.7.1-bin.zip		- The TIFF library
zlib.*.zip		 - zlib-1.2.2-bin.zip		- The z library
gdb.*.exe		 - gdb-20040521-1.exe		- GDB, the debugger
patches                  - patches			- Directory containing generic patches
patches-Custom		 - patches-Custom		- Directory containing custom patches


Supporting files going into the installer
-----------------------------------------
In the scripts directory are all the support files that are needed to 
actually do the complete build after the sources unpacked on the
target machine.  These scripts are obviously also put in the installer.

The list of scripts is rather long, but here it goes

NAME OF SCRIPT		- TYPE	- DESCRIPTION

apply-patches.sh	- bash	- Apply patches to the source tree
create-log-tar.sh	- bash 	- At the end create log file of the result
create-set-gnustep-intall-dir.sh
			- bash	- create /etc/profile.d file for MinGW that
				  sets the gnustep installation directory
fstab.bat		- DOS	- create fstab file and set initial envirionment
fstab.sh		- bash  - used by fstab.bat
install-base.sh		- bash	- builds ffcall, libobjc, base and copies some
				  DLL's and libraries to the right location
install-make.sh		- bash	- configures and installs make, also
				  removes mingw's libobjc files
install-gui.sh		- bash  - build gui and back and copies some DLL's and 
			  	  libraries to the right location
run-msys.bat		- DOS	- Runs a bash script in the msys shell.
set-gnustep-system.sh	- bash	- Set the main environment variables and source GNUstep.sh
test-base-installation-success.sh 
			- bash	- Test if the base build succeeded by running a simple program
test-gui-installation-success.sh
			- bash  - Test if the gui build succeeded by checing the existence of
			  	  the gnustep-gui.dll file
